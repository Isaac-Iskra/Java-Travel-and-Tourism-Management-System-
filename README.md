# Java-Travel-and-Tourism-Management-System-
A simple example of a Travel and Tourism Management system written in Java

The code is a Java program for a Tourism and Travel Management system. The program provides a menu-based interface for the user to search for destinations, book tours, and cancel tours.

The program starts by displaying a welcome message to the user. It then enters a while loop that repeatedly prompts the user to choose an option from the menu until the user chooses to exit.

The menu has four options: search for a destination, book a tour, cancel a tour, and exit. When the user chooses an option, the program prompts the user for any necessary input (such as the destination, tour name, tour date, etc.) and calls a method to perform the selected action.

The program uses a switch statement to determine which action to take based on the user's input. If the user selects the search option, the program prompts the user for a destination, duration, and number of people, and then calls a method to search for available tours. If the user selects the book option, the program prompts the user for their name, contact information, the tour name, and the tour date, and then calls a method to book the tour. If the user selects the cancel option, the program prompts the user for their name, contact information, the tour name, and the tour date, and then calls a method to cancel the tour.

If the user chooses to exit, the program displays a message and exits the program.

The program uses a Scanner object to read input from the user, and the System.out.println() method to display messages to the user.
